## Why Sweet-RL
 
It exists dozens of Reinforcement Learning frameworks and algorithms implementations.
Yet, most of them suffer of poor modularity and ease of understanding. This is why, I started to implement my own: Sweet-RL.
It's so sweet that you can switch from Tensorflow 2.1 to PyTorch 1.4 with a single configuration line:

## Getting started

### Install sweet-rl  

First, create a virtualenv:  
```bash
python3.x -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/ 
# or: virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/ -p python3
source ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/bin/activate
```
And then, install project dependancies:  
```bash
make install # or pip install -e .
```

### First execution  

Run a DQN training:  
```bash
python -m sweet.run --env=CartPole-V0 --algo=dqn --ml=tf

# Parameters:

```

| PPO           | Soon                  |               |



## Troubleshootings

* Tensorflow 2.x doesn't work with Python 3.8 so far, so only Python versions 3.6 and 3.7 are supported


## History/Author(s)

I started this open-source RL framework in january 2020 as a consecration of my passion for Reinforcement Learning.
Besides coding open-source project, i work for both Airbus and IRT Saint-Exupéry on Earth Observation satellites. Our team is focus on mission planning for satellites and Reinforcement Learning is an approach to solve it.
