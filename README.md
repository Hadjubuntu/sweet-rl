## Why Sweet-RL
 
It exists dozens of Reinforcement Learning frameworks and algorithms implementations.
Yet, most of them suffer of poor modularity and ease of understanding. This is why, I started to implement my own: Sweet-RL.
It's so sweet that you can switch from Tensorflow 2.1 to PyTorch 1.4 with a single configuration line:

## Getting started

### Install sweet-rl  

First, create a virtualenv:  
```bash
python3.x -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/ 
# or: virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/ -p python3
source ~/.virtualenvs/sweet/bin/activate
```
And then, install project dependancies:  
```bash
make install # or pip install -e .
```

### First execution  

Run a DQN training:  
```bash
python -m sweet.run --env=CartPole-V0 --algo=dqn --ml=tf

# Parameters:
#  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
#  --env ENV      Environment to play with (eg. 'CartPole-v0')
#  --algo ALGO    RL agent ('dqn', 'a2c')
#  --ml ML        ML platform ('tf' or 'torch')
#  --model MODEL  Model ('dense', 'conv')
```

### Custom neural network

If you want to specify your own model instead of default ones, take a look to
`sweet.agents.dqn.experiments.train_custom_model`

| PPO           | Soon                  |               |



## Troubleshootings

* Tensorflow 2.x doesn't work with Python 3.8 so far, so only Python versions 3.6 and 3.7 are supported


## History/Author

I started this open-source RL framework in january 2020, at first to take benefit of tensorflow 2.x readability without sacrifying the performance.
Besides coding open-source project, i work for both Airbus and IRT Saint-Exupéry on Earth Observation satellites. Our team is focus on mission planning for satellites and Reinforcement Learning is an approach to solve it.

It is supposed that you have knowledge in RL, if it is not the case, take a look to the [spinningup from OpenAI](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)
